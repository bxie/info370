					<p>In this class you'll learn how to think like a data scientist. You'll learn what data scientists do and how they do it. You'll also learn about the contexts in which a data scientist exists. By the end of the course, you should be able to enter any organization and begin to understand the social and technical contexts in which you help make decisions. If you want to be a great data scientist, this is the course for you.</p>

					Learning objectives for the course:
					<ol>
						<li>Comprehend the practice of data science as an interactive, iterative process.</li>
						<li>Critique the quality of data, models, and results within a decision context.</li>
						<li>Consider contextual and critical perspectives in data science</li>
						<li>Have familiarity using computational tools that support data scientists</li>
						<li>Understand what data scientists do in various organizational and social contexts</li>
					</ol>

					<!--TODO: Update this-->
					<!--<p>To learn these things, this course has three major phases:</p>-->
					<!---->
					<!--<ul>-->
						<!--<li>Two weeks of context setting about software, software engineers, and society</li>-->
						<!--<li>Five weeks of readings and skills on grand challenges in software engineering</li>-->
						<!--<li>Four weeks of software engineering practice</li>-->
					<!--</ul>-->

					<!--<p>Additionally, we'll use the labs throughout the quarter to practice interpersonal skills critical to being a great software engineer.</p>								-->
					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
					
					<p>You should have aspirations to be a data scientist or to work closely with them. Because we'll use data to inform decisions, you should also know:</p>
					<ul>
					    <li>How to use a scripting language (R, Python) to manipulate data</li>
					    <li>How to use command line</li>
					    <li>How to use Git and GitHub</li>
						<li>How to access a Web API</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The prerequisite course, INFO 201 (the Technical Foundations of Informatics), should be suitable preparation for the above. Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://info201.github.io/">INFO 201 online book</a> to refresh your knowledge of the course.</p>
						
					<!-- QUARTERLY -->
					<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
					
					<p>We are available to talk about jobs, careers, graduate school, research, class, taboos, and anything else. Benji's office hours this quarter are <b>Monday and Tuesday 9-10:30 am in MGH-015</b> (door is locked, so just knock to get in). Greg's office hours this quarter are <b>Wednesday 2-3:20 and Thursday 1-3PM in CSE atrium tables</b>. Occasionally we need to schedule things over it. To guarantee we'll be around, write to us in advance to secure a time.</p>
					
					<h2>Devices in Class</h2>
					
					<p>We will use smartphones and laptops throughout the quarter to facilitate activities and project work in-class. <i>However</i>, research and student feedback clearly shows that using devices on non-class related activities not only harms your own learning, but other students' learning as well. Therefore, <b>I only allow device usage during activities that require devices. At all other times, you should not be using your device.</b> We'll help you remember this by announcing when to bring devices out and when to put them away.</p>

					<!-- QUARTERLY -->
					<h2 id="schedule">Typical Week</h2>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Sunday: Do reading assignments (read readings, review and run scripts). Complete reflection survey.</li>

					<div class="alert alert-danger" id="late-policy">
						Late work receives no credit unless you can provide a note from a health care professional or provost documenting the reason for your absence.
						However, you can miss up to 3 activities without penalty and without documentation.
						This should be enough to allow for sickness, unavoidable travel, or other personal matters.
						<!--If you miss a reading quiz due to sickness, you can make up the quiz credit by sending a critique of the reading to me within a week of the due date that reports at least three improvements to the content, including high level issues such as topics that should be discussed or points you think are wrong, to low level issues including spelling, grammar, or clarity.-->
					</div>

					<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
					
					<p>Each day in class we'll practice some skill. You'll get <a href="#grading">0.5 points</a> if you engage in and complete the activity. How to get credit for the activity will depend on the activity; sometimes being present will be enough, sometimes being to class on time will be enough, and sometimes you'll have to turn something in.</p>
					
					<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

					<p>To access the readings, you will do the following:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Click on the reading (a link to a Google doc) on the <a href="#schedule">course schedule</a></li>
						<li>Copy the google doc to your personal INFO 370 folder (which we shared with you at the beginning of the course). <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/49114" target="_blank">Instructions on making a copy of a file in Google Drive.</a></li>
						<li>Read through the google doc/reading. Highlight and <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/65129" target="_blank">comment</a> any parts which are confusing.</li>
						<li>Complete the questions marked "TODO".</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						You should complete your readings and reflection <i>before</i> at the beginning of each lecture (twice a week).
						The Google Doc in your personal Drive folder is your submission (not using Canvas for readings).
						Each class, you'll come prepared to discuss the assigned reading.
					</p>

					<p>The day that each reading is due, we'll do the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Share what you're confused about.</li>
						<li>We clarify confusions.</li>
						<li>We give you some questions to answer individually about the assigned reading (a "Reading Quiz").</li>
						<li>You turn in your answer.</li>
						<li>You discuss your answers with your neighbor.</li>
						<li>We discuss the correct answers as a class.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						You will receive <a href="#grading">0.5 points</a> for completing the reading and reflection before class (on the Google Doc).
						You will receive up to another 0.5 points for getting the in-class reading quiz correct.
						We will give partial credit for partially correct answers on the reading quiz, at our discretion.
						In total, you can receive up to 1 point per reading.
					</p>

					<h2 id="homework">Individual Homework</h2>

					<p>There will be a few individual homework assignments which are separate from reading assignments and project milestones.</p>

					<ol>
						<li><a href="homeworks/review-prerequisite.html">Review of prerequisite knowledge</a> (5 points). Out Wed 9/27. Due <del>Tues 10/3</del> <b>Fri 10/6</b> (updated).</li>
						<li><a href="homeworks/case-study-analysis.html">Analyzing a Data Science Case Study (10 points)</a>. Out Wed 10/4. Due Tues 10/10.</li>
						<li>Assessment of probability (10 points). Out Wed 10/11. Due Tues 10/17.</li>
						<li>Project and course reflection (5 points). Out Mon 12/11. Due Mon 12/11.</li>
						<!--<li><a href="homeworks/TODO">Review of prerequisite knowledge</a> (5 points)</li>-->
						<!--<li><a href="homeworks/TODO">Comprehension of data science process</a> (10 points)</li>-->
						<!--<li><a href="homeworks/TODO">Assessment of probability</a> (9 points)</li>-->
						<!--<li><a href="homeworks/TODO">Project and course reflection</a> (5 points)</li>-->
					</ol>

					<p>
						All homeworks are due by 11:59:00 PM PST on the specified date.
					</p>

					<p>
						The goal of the individual homework assignments is to ensure you an understanding of specific concepts which are critical to your understanding of data science.
					</p>

					<!--<p>The midterm will test your knowledge of the reading from the first seven weeks of class. Why include a midterm? It'll incentivize you to read more closely and retain what you read better. It'll also help me differentiate who really knows the material and who doesn't, assigning grades that best reflect your knowledge. It will cover every topic in the assigned readings and every skill practiced in class.<p>-->

					<!--<p>The midterm will consist entirely of true/false questions. (Fun!) Your final points will be <code>12 x fraction_correct</code>. Also note that any questions that more than 60% of students in the class get wrong will be excluded from the final score as they were likely confusing or concerned material that I poorly taught.</p>-->
	
					<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
					
					<p>The project is split across 8 milestones/assignments, each worth a different amount:</p> <!--TODO: update number of assignments-->
					
					<ol>
						<li>Group formation and initial questions (2 points). Out Wed 10/18. Due Sun 10/22.</li>
						<li>Feasibility analysis (3 points). Out Mon 10/23. Due Sun 10/29.</li>
						<li>Proposal (4 points). Out Mon 10/30. Due Sun 11/5.</li>
						<li>Proposal Review (2 points). Out Mon 11/6. Due Tues 11/7.</li>
						<li>Proposal Revision (3 points). Out Wed 11/8. Due Sun 11/12.</li>
						<li>Project check-in meeting (2 points). Out Wed 11/16. Due Tues 11/21.</li>
						<li>Presentation (10 points). Out Mon 11/13. Due Mon 12/4.</li>
						<li>Artifact (14 points). Out Mon 11/13. Due Fri 12/8.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						All assignments except the Project check-in meeting are due by 11:59:00 PM PST on the specified date.
					</p>

					<p>
						The goal of the project is for you to practice the process of data science to make or inform a decision,
						so you can experience the nuances of formulating a good question, setting up process, constraints, and plans in relation to a context. Note, however, that because the timeline for the project is so short, it <em>won't</em> give you a deep, longitudinal experience with software engineering, nor will it give you practice with massive complexity or scale. I believe these are experiences best left to practice in industry, as they're <em>very</em> difficult to replicate in the artificial setting of school.</p>
					
					<p>Note that in the final three weeks of the course, we'll use class time primarily for team meeting time. The TA and I will be available as free consultants, helping you debug, do research on libraries, and offer advice on implementation. You are not required to come to class those days, but I highly recommend using the time for team coordination and help.</p>
