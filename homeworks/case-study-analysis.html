<div class="lead">Benjamin Xie & Greg Nelson</div>

<p>
    The objective of this homework is to practice comprehending the data science process and decision contexts.
    For this assignment, you will read through a case study and methodology from ProPublica on machine bias in predicting future criminals.
</p>

<h2>1. Read the Case Study & methodology</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Read the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing/" target="_blank">ProPublica case study</a>.</li>
    <li>Read the accompanying <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm" target="_blank">article on their methodology</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Decompose the case study</h2>
<p>
    Decompose the case study by answering the following questions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Goals</b>: What are they trying to use data science to do?</li>
    <li><b>Prior Knowledge</b>: What did they know or assume beforehand? Why?</li>
    <li><b>Roles/ responsibilities in organization</b>: What was the organization's expectations of these data scientists? (you may need to look at the ProPublica website or read about the organization to answer this question)</li>
    <li><b>Social Relationship</b>: How did they interact with other stakeholders when conducting this analysis?</li>
    <li><b>Models</b>: How did they represent their objects of analysis?</li>
    <li><b>Choices</b>: What options exist for the decision they are informing?</li>
    <li><b>Outcomes</b>: Given these choices, what are the outcomes of deciding on a given choice?</li>
    <li><b>Missing from analysis:</b> What is missing from this analysis?</li>
</ol>


<h2>3. Synthesizing the analysis</h2>
<p>
    Write up your findings in a ~500-2000 word (excluding any additional citations) paper or report.
    This paper/report should read coherently (so do <i>not</i> just answer each question above and submit a bullet-pointed list).
</p>

<p>
    <b>You will submit this assignment by putting a Google Doc or PDF of your write-up in your personal INFO 370 folder.</b>
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>This assignment is out of 10 points, although there is an option for extra credit.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Up to 1 point for answering each question listed in Section 2 (max of 8pts)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>1 point for each question answered completely (answer with explanations/evidence to substantiate it).</li>
        <li>0.5 points for each incomplete answer (answer with incomplete evidence to substantiate it).</li>
        <li>0 points for each question left unanswered.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Up to 2 points for comprehensibility.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>2 points for a paper that is easily understood, reads coherently and has no major spelling or grammer mistakes which detract from our ability to understand it.</li>
        <li>0.1-1.9 points for a paper that is not fully coherent or understandable or has major spelling or grammer mistakes which detract from our ability to understand it.</li>
        <li>0 points for totally ignoring these insturctions and submitting a bullet-pointed list of answers to the questions above.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Up to 1 point of <b>extra credit</b> for incorporating and referencing another research paper or report which further develops your paper.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This additional reference must be substantial (e.g. a research publication or government report. A blog post or basic news article likely isn't good enough). You must also cite it!</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
