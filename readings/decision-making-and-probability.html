<h1>Decision-Making and Probability</h1>
<div class="lead">Benji Xie & Greg Nelson</div>

<h2>Decision are Choices, Outcomes, and Values of Outcomes</h2>
<p>
    Making decisions is about choosing the options that leads to the outcome with the highest total value.
    In business scenarios one might predict a dollar amount for the value for each possible outcome.
    In a personal or other scenario one might imagine how much something is worth in dollars and use that as a value (or otherwise use numbers to express how much one wants an outcome);
    note that this is potentially error-prone / inappropriate, but let's (potentially dangerously) assume someone takes the time to carefully consider how much that outcome is worth to them and gives it a dollar amount.
</p>

<h3>When each choice has a certain outcome</h3>
<p>
    In this case, you look at the outcomes and choose the choice that has the highest valued outcome.
    For example, on my way to class I walk by someone selling chocolate. I might consider this decision quickly as:
</p>

<table class="table table-striped text-left">
    <tr>Table 1: Value given choice</tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Choice</b></td>
        <td><b>Outcome</b></td>
        <td><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>I eat chocolate</td>
        <td>"+$10" in happiness</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Do not buy chocolate</td>
        <td>I do not eat chocolate</td>
        <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    With this way of describing the choice, choosing to buy chocolate will lead to a higher-value outcome - a benefit "equivalent" to $10 from eating chocolate. Why $10? Well I just really like chocolate and I think I will be about as happy as if I had found $10 on the ground. Thus, choosing buy chocolate would optimize my potential value from the decision (gain $10 in value vs. gain $0).
</p>

<h3>When each choice also has a cost</h3>

<p>
    As I go to buy the chocolate, I realize the chocolate costs money - $5. I reconsider my values for each outcome, subtracting the costs of making that choice.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped text-left">
    <tr>Table 2: Value given choice and costs</tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Choice</b></td>
        <td><b>Outcome</b></td>
        <td><b>Value</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>I eat chocolate</td>
        <td>+$10 (in happiness) - $5 (cost) = +$5 net benefit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Do not buy chocolate</td>
        <td>I do not eat chocolate</td>
        <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Buy chocolate still has the highest valued outcome at $5, so I reach for my wallet. However, I suddenly realize I'm not so sure there's only one possible outcome from that choice.

    When there are many possible outcomes that are unknown / uncertain
    Really, most decisions in life do not have a guaranteed outcome. Each choice can have multiple possible outcomes. In our example we'll add another possible outcome.

    Looking over the person selling chocolate, I realize I don't know them, I haven't seen them before, and they are wearing a strange costume. I add a new outcome (I leave the value entry blank if that outcome cannot happen for that choice).

</p>

<table class="table table-striped text-left">
    <tr>Table 3: Value given choices with uncertain outcomes</tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td colspan="3" class="text-center">Outcomes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><b>Eat nothing</b></td>
        <td><b>Eat chocolate</b></td>
        <td><b>Eat poisoned chocolate, go to hospital</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Choice: Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>+$10 (happiness) - $5 (cost) = $5 (net benefit)</td>
        <td>-$1000 (hospital) - $5 (chocolate) = -$1005 (net benefit)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Choice: Do not buy chocolate</td>
        <td>$0</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Now that there are multiple outcomes, there are different rules I might use to decide. Here are two fairly extreme rules:
</p>

Decision Rules:
<ul>
    <li><b>Minimize the worst possible outcome</b>: Take the worst outcome for each choice, then choose the choice with the best (of the worst) outcomes.</li>
    <li><b>Maximize the best possible outcome</b>: Take the best outcome for each choice, then choose the choice with the best (of the best) outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For minimize the worst possible outcome, I'd choose to not buy chocolate.
    To maximize the best possible outcome, I'd choose to buy the chocolate.
</p>

<h3>When you're biased and inadvertently change your analysis to get the choice you want</h3>

<p>
    Now, the thought occurs to me, that maybe I'll eat half of the chocolate, meet someone that looks hungry on the way, 
    share my chocolate, start up a wonderful conversation, one thing leads to another, and - fast forward 10 years into the future 
    - we're a happy couple and life is awesome. I add a new outcome to my decision table.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped text-left">
    <tr>Table 4: Value given choices with uncertain outcomes</tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td colspan="4" class="text-center">Outcomes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><b>Eat nothing</b></td>
        <td><b>Eat chocolate</b></td>
        <td><b>Eat poisoned chocolate, go to hospital</b></td>
        <td><b>Share chocolate with my future partner</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Choice: Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>+$10 (happiness) - $5 (chocolate) = $5 (net benefit)</td>
        <td>-$1000 (hospital) - $5 (chocolate) = -$1005 (net benefit)</td>
        <td>$10,000,000 (happiness) - $5 (cost) = $9,999,995 (net benefit)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Choice: Do not buy chocolate</td>
        <td>$0</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Now, the two decision rules from before seems really unsatisfactory.
    If I try to, I can probably think about extreme outcomes (bad or good) for any choice I make,
    which can heavily influence the choice I "should" make based on those rules.

</p>

<h2>Decision theory</h2>
<p>
    Decision theory combines the choices-outcomes-values model of a decision along with a probability distribution of the outcomes for each choice.
    Practitioners of orthodox (prevalent / accepted) decision theory recommend one choose the choice that has the highest "expected" value, adjusted for the probability of that outcome. For example, for the decision below with the following probabilities:
</p>

<table class="table table-striped text-left">
    <tr>Table 5: Probability table for chocolate outcomes</tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Choice</b></td>
        <td><b>Outcome</b></td>
        <td><b>Probability</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>Eat chocolate</td>
        <td>0.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>Eat poisoned chocolate</td>
        <td>0.009999</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
        <td>Share chocolate with future partner</td>
        <td>0.000001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy chocolate</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    We can make our decision by first calculating our expected outcome, the product of the value of each outcome with the likelihood of it occuring.
    <math>1+1</math>
</p>

<p>
    Decision analysis without probability can change based on unlikely or extreme outcomes.
    In general, it can be hard to define all the possible outcomes; decision analysis tends to just focus on some set of outcomes.
    Some people in the decision analysis community try to come up with ways to deal with possible outcomes, this but limiting outcomes is a fundamental limitation of the method.
    In the end, it's hard to tell if you have included all the possible choices and possible outcomes that matter in an analysis.
