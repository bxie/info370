<h1>Milestone 7: Presentation</h1>
<div class="lead">Gregory L. Nelson (based on material made with Benjamin Xie)</div>

<p>
    An important part of any data scientist's job is to share your process and results with your peers and receive feedback.
    This presentation will give you an opportunity to practice that skill.
</p>

<p>
    For this assignment, you will prepare a presentation to communicate your work with other data scientists.
    You will want to communicate the decision context to situate your analysis and then explain how your analysis helps inform a decision.
    You will also want to provide enough technical detail to convince your audience that your analysis is robust and appropriate.
</p>

<p>
    Following your presentation, your audience should know enough and be engaged enough to ask questions to help stimulate new ideas.
    This Q&A period will give you some practice at thinking and communicating effective answers with minimal preparation time.
</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>
    You will give a presentation with an option to use a projector, whiteboard, and/or handouts.
    You will present for 10-12 minutes.
    Groups of audience members will then discuss the presentation amongst themselves and formulate questions for 1-2 minutes.
    Finally, there will be ~5 minutes for your audience to ask you questions.

    During your presentation you will want to convey the following things (in any order that makes sense):
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Decision context</b>: Convey to your audience your decision context (stakeholders, assumptions, decision, choices, outcomes, ethical considerations) and question to answer. Providing a rich use case or scenario often helps with this.</li>
    <li><b>Method</b>: Explain how you will answer your question and why it is appropriate.</li>
    <li><b>Data</b>: Share the data sources you use. Provide background information about the data (who collected the data, why, how you accessed it) and explain how you cleaned it (dealt with missing or incomplete or unclear data).</li>
    <li><b>Results</b>: Share the key findings from your analysis (likely with the help of visual representations) and interpret them.</li>
    <li><b>Connecting decision context and analysis</b>: You explicitly explain how the findings of your analysis and how target stakeholders can use them to inform a specific decision.</li>
    <li><b>Limitation and future work</b>: You describe shortcomings of your analysis, and describe future work you plan on doing (e.g. capstone) or that others can build off of.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    See the <a href="#grade">Grading Criteria</a> to see a more detailed breakdown of how we will assess you.
</p>

<h2>Common Missteps</h2>
<p>
    Often times, great people struggle to deliver great presentations.
    Below are a few common mistakes to presenting data science.
    We hope we don't see them in your presentation!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not stating the decision context and question to answer.</li>
    <li>Presenting data or analysis in graphs/charts without interpreting it (describing it like you interpreted in tab 1.2).</li>
    <li>Not connecting your analysis to the decision context and question to answer.</li>
    <li>Running out of time without finishing your presentation.</li>
    <li>Slides are too dense and audience is too fixated on reading slides and stopped listening to presenter. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_attention_effect" target="_blank">split attention effect</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The best way to avoid these mistakes is to 1) focus on the big picture objective of what you want to convey, 2) practice delivering your talk, 3) cut out everything that isn't required in conveying the big picture.
    See <a href="#further">Further reading</a> for resources to help you give a presentation.

<h2 id="grade">Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>
    This assignment is out of 8 points (with an opportunity for extra credit) and you will be graded on your presentation you give in class.
    If you create any slides or visuals to display, include them (or a link to them) in your project GitHub or project wiki.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 point: Decision Context. You convey the decision context surrounding your study.</li>
    <li>1 point: Data. You convey where your data came from, how it was cleaned, and how it was used.</li>
    <li>1 point: Method. You explain and justify your analysis methods and choices.</li>
    <li>1 point: Results. You describe and <b>interpret</b> the results of your analysis</li>
    <li>1 point: Informing a decision. You explain how your target audience may use these results to inform a decision.</li>
    <li>0.5 points: Limitations. You describe the shortcomings of your analysis and assumptions you are making.</li>
    <li>0.5 points: Future work. You describe ways to improve and deepen the analysis, as well as challenges in doing so.</li>
    <li>1 point: Presentation clarity. You communicate and use your slides effectively.</li>
    <li>0.5 points: Questions. You effectively respond to questions.</li>
    <li>0.5 points: Audience. You engage as an audience.</li>
    <li><b>Extra credit</b> (0-1 point): Engaging your audience. You engage your audience in an "above and beyond" way.</li>
</ul>
