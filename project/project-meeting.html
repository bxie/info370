<h1>Milestone 6: Project Check-In Meeting</h1>
<div class="lead">Gregory L. Nelson (based on material made with Benjamin Xie)</div>

<p>
    Now that your project proposals are complete and we know what decision you want to inform and how, we'll want to meet with you to clarify questions and ensure you can see your project through.
    We will also provide you with guidelines of our expectations for you and this project, and answer specific questions about how the final deliverables will be graded/evaluated.
    By the end of this meeting, we (the instructors) and you and your team should by on the same page regarding what needs to be done and how.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare for meeting with instructor</h2>
<p>
    You'll want to schedule time (we'll send out a Doodle poll or equivalent) with the instructor who will mentor your project.
    Find a time where multiple team members (preferably all) can make.

    Preferably we will meet on Monday Feb 19 in person, but due to your schedule constraints we may need to meet via Skype during the week.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have scheduled your time, you'll want to do some preparation to ensure we use our time effectively.
    Come with ideas on how we can help you and your team. You may come with specific questions or concerns.
    To make this more concrete, come with at least one of each of the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>question about project or deliverable</li>
    <li>concern about project - for example, how well it will fit into your portfolio</li>
    <li>vision of potential impact</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step 2: Meet with instructor</h2>
<p>
    You will then meet with an instructor.
    The purpose of this meeting is to make the project and the expectations of the deliverable clear.
    Come on time and prepared.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Write-up meeting notes</h2>
<p>
    After you have met with your mentor/instructor, you'll want to archive the meeting notes for the rest of your teammates and for the future.
    Create a page in your GitHub wiki titled "Mentor Meeting Notes." In it, write the following notes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clarifications made in meeting</li>
    <li>Project scope</li>
    <li>Expectations of project deliverables</li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

This assignment is out of 2 points and you will submit it by pushing changes to you team GitHub repository:

<p>Your shared GitHub space will be graded on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 point: Team members came to the meeting on-time and prepared.</li>
    <li>1 point: Meeting notes (as page on wiki) synthesizes useful and actionable takeaways from meeting.</li>
</ul>
