<h1>Milestone 1: Group formation and initial questions</h1> <!--TODO: add points for each hw -->
<div class="lead">Benjamin Xie & Gregory L. Nelson</div>

<p>The first step of any software project is defining <em>why</em> the project is happening at all. What problem is it solving? Why have the specific people on a team come together to solve it? What makes them the right people to solve it? Do they have the skills to solve it? In this homework, you're going to answer these questions, designing your organization intentionally.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Creating a team</h2>

<p>Most teams come together around trust first and then choose a problem. This is because is trusting relationships are necessary for collaboration: they provide the <em>psychological safety</em> <a href="#edmondson">(Edmondson 1999)</a> necessary for risk taking, feedback, and open communication. Because of this, we're going to form teams first, and then identify problems.</p>

<p>Your team must be <b>3 to 5 people</b>. (We want the teams large enough that you encounter communication and coordination complexities that reflect real teams in practice). Because of the size of this class, you're not going to be able to form the <em>exact</em> team you might want. You're also going to have to interview each other to assess the potential for trusting relationships.</p>

<p>Here's the process to follow</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you already have a trusting relationship with someone in the class, team with them. This will provide a solid foundation.</li>
    <li>Start interviewing classmates to select other teammates. Focus your questions on their <em>motives</em>, as teams that are working toward the same goals perform better than those that don't. Potential questions to ask:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>What do you want to get out of this project?</li>
        <li>What time do you have to contribute to this class?</li>
        <li>What skills do you have (and do they complement ours)?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Once you have a team, <b>write your names down on the team registration sheet</b> for credit for today.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create group infrastructure</h2>

<p>Your team needs infrastructure to effectively communicate and collaborate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up a <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel" target="_blank">Slack channel for the group</a> within the class Slack organization and add all members.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you choose to make the channel private, you must add the instructors (bxie, glnelson) to the private channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Create/join your team's GitHub repository via GitHub classroom. <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/xF3PUpGm" target="_blank"><b>GitHub classroom link to create/join group repository</b></a></li> <!--QUARTERLY-->
        <li>Set up a <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started-team-drive/" target="_blank">Google Team Drive</a> for your group and all members and the instructors (bxie@UW.edu, glnelson@UW.edu)</li> <!--QUARTERLY-->
    </ul>

<h2>Step 3: Identify 3 potential data science questions</h2>

<p>Ideate questions you can answer within the scope of this quarter. Remember that questions are <em>not</em> solutions&mdash;they are characterization of an unknown.</p>

<p>We fully expect this step to take more time than we have in class. Discuss, debate, and deliberate outside of class to arrive at a problem you're all excited about solving this quarter.</p>

<p>Because we'll have limited time in this class to build, here are a few constraints on the questions you choose:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It should be a <em>small</em> question, not requiring a massive, complex answer.</li>
    <li>It should be answerable with the use of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Create a page on your <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/" target="_blank">GitHub organization's wiki</a>
    with your 3 potential data science questions. Title the wiki page "Potential Questions".
    On the page, write each research question and an accompanying paragraph for each question providing more information about this question.
    This additional information may include some of (but not necessarily all of) the following:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Goals</b>: What are you trying to use data science to do? What decision are you informing?</li>
        <li><b>Prior Knowledge</b>: What do you know or assume beforehand? Why?</li>
        <li><b>Social Relationship</b>: How may you interact with other stakeholders when conducting your analysis?</li>
        <li><b>Models</b>: How may you represent your objects of analysis?</li>
        <li><b>Choices</b>: What options exist for the decision you are informing?</li>
        <li><b>Outcomes</b>: Given these choices, what are the outcomes of deciding on a given choice?</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>For activity credit, <b>write your names down</b> on the team registration sheet.</p>
<p>For homework credit, <b>you will have updated your team GitHub repository's wiki as stated in Step 2.</b></p>

<p>Your shared GitHub space will be graded on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>0.25 points for a Slack channel and Team Google Drive created with all members added.</li>
    <li>0.25 points for a GitHub repository with all members added.</li>
    <li>
        1.5 points for at least 3 questions and accompanying explanations added to your
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/" target="_blank">GitHub organization's wiki</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
