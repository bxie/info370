<h1>Milestone 1: Group formation and initial questions</h1> <!--TODO: add points for each hw -->
<div class="lead">Benjamin Xie & Gregory L. Nelson</div>

<p>The first step of any software project is defining <em>why</em> the project is happening at all. What problem is it solving? Why have the specific people on a team come together to solve it? What makes them the right people to solve it? Do they have the skills to solve it? In this homework, you're going to answer these questions, designing your organization intentionally.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Creating a team</h2>

<p>Most teams come together around trust first and then choose a problem. This is because is trusting relationships are necessary for collaboration: they provide the <em>psychological safety</em> <a href="#edmondson">(Edmondson 1999)</a> necessary for risk taking, feedback, and open communication. Because of this, we're going to form teams first, and then identify problems.</p>

<p>Your team must be <b>3 to 5 people</b>. (I want the teams large enough that you encounter communication and coordination complexities that reflect real teams in practice). Because of the size of this class, you're not going to be able to form the <em>exact</em> team you might want. You're also going to have to interview each other to assess the potential for trusting relationships.</p>

<p>Here's the process to follow</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you already have a trusting relationship with someone in the class, team with them. This will provide a solid foundation.</li>
    <li>Start interviewing classmates to select other teammates. Focus your questions on their <em>motives</em>, as teams that are working toward the same goals perform better than those that don't. Potential questions to ask:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Why are you taking this class?</li>
        <li>What time do you have to contribute to this class?</li>
        <li>What skills do you have (and do they complement ours)?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>Once you have a team, <b>write your names down on the team registration sheet</b> for credit for today.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create group infrastructure</h2>

<p>Your team needs infrastructure to effectively communicate and collaborate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up a <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel" target="_blank">Slack channel for the group</a> within the class Slack organization.</li>
        <li>Set up a GitHub organization for your group.</li>
    </ul>
<!--TODO: clarify GitHub-->

<h2>Step 3: Identify 3 potential data science questions</h2>

<p>Ideate questions you can answer within the scope of this quarter. Remember that questions are <em>not</em> solutions&mdash;they are characterization of an unknown.</p>

<p>We fully expect this step to take more time than we have in class. Discuss, debate, and deliberate outside of class to arrive at a problem you're all excited about solving this quarter.</p>

<p>Because we'll have limited time in this class to build, here are a few constraints on the questions you choose:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It should be a <em>small</em> question, not requiring a massive, complex answer.</li>
    <li>It should be answerable with the use of data.</li>
</ul>

<!--<h2>Step 4: Assign roles</h2>-->

<!--<p>This is a critical step, as it ensures at least one person is responsible for every important function of a team.</p>-->

<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Who is responsible for <b>marketing</b>? This person will do all tasks that involve disseminating what you build outside of your team.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Who is responsible for <b>product management</b>? This person has the final say in <em>what</em> you're building, owning the requirements of the product.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Who is responsible for <b>design</b>? This person has the final say in how product requirements are met.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Who is responsible for <b>engineering</b>? These people are responsible for meeting product requirements with code.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Who is responsible for <b>support</b>? This person receives feedback from people outside your team and disseminates the feedback internally.</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--<p>Remember that one person can take on multiple roles (and given your team sizes, each of you probably <em>should</em> take on multiple roles). Choose people who have the skills for the role or are eager to learn the skills for the role.</p>-->

<!--<h2>Step 5: Create a shared workspace</h2>-->

<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub Organization</a> to represent your team (for it to be free, you'll need to make it open source).</li>-->
    <!--<li>Write your mission statement in the organization's description.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Ensure everyone on your team has access to the organization</li>-->
    <!--<li>Create a repository to store your project work and give everyone access</li>-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash; QUARTERLY &ndash;&gt;-->
    <!--<li>Give your your instructor (GitHub "andyjko") and your TA (GitHub "bxie") read access to the repository for grading purposes</li>-->
    <!--<li>In your repository's README, write your problem statement (defining what the goals of the repository) and write a list of your teammates and their responsibilities.</li>-->
    <!--<li>Make sure that each teammate's GitHub profile is associated with their full name so we can probably grade using your contributions on GitHub. (Otherwise we won't know who you are!)</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>For activity credit, <b>write your names down</b> on the team registration sheet.</p>
<p>For homework credit, <b>submit a link to your organization on Canvas.</b></p>

<p>Your shared GitHub space will be graded on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>0.5 points for a public GitHub organization</li>
    <li>0.5 points for a public GitHub repository</li>
    <li>1.0 points for a mission statement with no spelling or grammar issues.</li>
    <li>2.0 points for a clear, concise, logically sound problem statement that defines the problem being solved. We will deduct points for statements that focus on solutions instead of problems.</li>
</ul>
